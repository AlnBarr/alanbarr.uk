<h2>The unusual name, Reconquista?</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Reconquista</strong> was a long period of conflict in the Iberian Peninsula (modern day Spain and Portugal) during which Christian kingdoms gradually took territory from Muslim rulers. The word <em>Reconquista</em> means “reconquest,” referring to the Christian aim of reclaiming land that had been under Muslim control since the early 700s. 
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
By 1200 CE, much of southern and central Spain was ruled by Muslim states known collectively as <strong>Al-Andalus</strong>. In the north, several Christian kingdoms had grown stronger over time. The most important of these were:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Castile</li>
    <li>Aragon</li>
    <li>Navarre</li>
    <li>Portugal</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Although these kingdoms sometimes fought among themselves, they increasingly cooperated against Muslim rulers in the south.
</p>

<h3>Turning Point: Las Navas de Tolosa (1212)</h3>

<p>
A major turning point in the Reconquista was the <strong>Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa</strong> in <strong>1212</strong>. A coalition of Christian armies defeated the Almohad Caliphate, one of the most powerful Muslim states in Iberia at the time.
</p>

<p>
This victory greatly weakened Muslim control and allowed Christian kingdoms to expand more rapidly in the following centuries.
</p>

<h3>Christian Expansion (13th–15th Centuries)</h3>

<p>
After 1212, Christian forces captured many important cities, including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Córdoba</li>
    <li>Seville</li>
    <li>Valencia</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Muslim and Jewish populations often remained in these areas. For a time, they were allowed to practise their religions and maintain their communities, although restrictions increased as Christian rule became more firmly established.
</p>

<h3>The Fall of Granada (1492)</h3>

<p>
By the late 15th century, only one Muslim state remained: the <strong>Kingdom of Granada</strong> in southern Spain.
</p>

<p>
In <strong>1492</strong>, Granada surrendered to <strong>King Ferdinand of Aragon</strong> and <strong>Queen Isabella of Castile</strong>. This event is traditionally seen as the <strong>end of the Reconquista</strong>.
